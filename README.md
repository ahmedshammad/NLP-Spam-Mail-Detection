# NLP-Spam-Mail-Detection
The objective of the code is to build and evaluate two different machine learning models, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. The dataset used is a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or not spam, and the models are trained using features extracted from the text of these messages.

The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as NLTK, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. The NLTK library is used to download and access stopwords, which are words that are commonly used in the English language but are not useful for text analysis, and the Porter Stemmer, which is used to perform stemming, the process of reducing words to their root form. The Pandas library is used to read and manipulate the dataset, which is in TSV format, and Scikit-Learn is used for machine learning-related tasks such as vectorization, model selection, and evaluation.

Next, the code defines three functions: count_punct, clean_text, and train_and_eval_model. The count_punct function takes a string as input and returns the percentage of punctuation characters in the string. The clean_text function takes a string as input, removes all punctuation characters, converts all characters to lowercase, and performs stemming on the remaining words. The train_and_eval_model function takes a machine learning model, a parameter grid, and training and testing datasets as input, and performs a grid search over the parameter grid to find the best set of hyperparameters for the model. The function then fits the model on the training dataset, makes predictions on the testing dataset, and prints out the precision, recall, and accuracy scores of the model.

After defining these functions, the code reads in the SMS dataset and applies the count_punct and clean_text functions to create two new features: body_len, which is the length of the SMS message without spaces, and punct%, which is the percentage of punctuation characters in the SMS message. The dataset is split into training and testing datasets, and the TfidfVectorizer is used to convert the text data into numerical features. The TfidfVectorizer is configured to use the clean_text function as its analyzer function, which means that it will preprocess the text data before vectorizing it.

Two machine learning models, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, are trained and evaluated using the training and testing datasets. For each model, the train_and_eval_model function is called with the appropriate model and parameter grid. The parameter grid contains a range of hyperparameters for the model, and the grid search is performed using 5-fold cross-validation. The best set of hyperparameters is used to fit the model on the training dataset and make predictions on the testing dataset. Finally, the precision, recall, and accuracy scores of the model are printed out.

The code concludes with a comparison of the performance of the two models. The Random Forest model achieves a precision score of 0.96, a recall score of 0.76, and an accuracy score of 0.95. The Gradient Boosting model achieves a precision score of 0.91, a recall score of 0.84, and an accuracy score of 0.95. The Random Forest model outperforms the Gradient Boosting model in terms of precision, but the Gradient Boosting model outperforms the Random Forest model in terms of recall. Overall, both models perform well in classifying SMS messages as spam or not spam.
